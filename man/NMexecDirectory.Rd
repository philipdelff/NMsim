\title{Execute Nonmem inside a dedicated directory}
\usage{
NMexecDirectory(
  file.mod,
  path.nonmem,
  files.needed,
  dir.data = "..",
  system.type
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file.mod}{Path to a Nonmem input control stream.}

\item{path.nonmem}{Path to Nonmem executable. You may want to
control this with \code{NMdata::NMdataConf}.}

\item{files.needed}{Files needed to run the control stream. This
cold be a .phi file from which etas will be read. Notice,
input data set will be handled automatically, you do not need
to specify that.}

\item{dir.data}{If NULL, data will be copied into the temporary
directory, and Nonmem will read it from there. If not NULL,
dir.data must be the relative path from where Nonmem is run to
where the input data file is stored. This would be ".." if the
run directory is created in a directory where the data is
stored.}
}
\value{
A bash shell script for execution of Nonmem
}
\description{
Like PSN's execute with less features. But easier to control from
NMexec. NMexecDirectory is not intended to be run by the user. Use
\code{NMexec} or \code{NMsim} instead.
